            The Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan is administered by the
            Board of Trustees of the College Savings Plans of Nevada, chaired by
            the Nevada State Treasurer. Ascensus Broker Dealer Services, Inc.
            serves as the Program Manager. Wealthfront Advisers LLC, an
            SEC-registered investment adviser, serves as the investment adviser
            to the Plan. Wealthfront Brokerage LLC serves as the distributor and
            the underwriter of the Plan. Before you invest, consider whether
            your or the beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other
            state benefits such as financial aid, scholarship funds, and
            protection from creditors that are only available for investments in
            that state’s qualified tuition program. The effectiveness of the
            Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the tax liability of the
            client will depend on the client’s entire tax and investment
            profile, including purchases and dispositions in a client’s (or
            client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and type
            of investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period
            (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax loss harvesting may generate a
            higher number of trades due to attempts to capture losses.

          <br />
          <small data-aos="fade-up">
            There is a chance that trading attributed to tax loss harvesting may
            create capital gains and wash sales and could be subject to higher
            transaction costs and market impacts. In addition, tax loss
            harvesting strategies may produce losses, which may not be offset by
            sufficient gains in the account and may be limited to a $3,000
            deduction against income. The utilization of losses harvested
            through the strategy will depend upon the recognition of capital
            gains in the same or a future tax period, and in addition may be
            subject to limitations under applicable tax laws, e.g., if there are
            insufficient realized gains in the tax period, the use of harvested
            losses may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against income and
            distributions. Losses harvested through the strategy that are not
            utilized in the tax period when recognized (e.g., because of
            insufficient capital gains and/or significant capital loss
            carryforwards), generally may be carried forward to offset future
            capital gains, if any. All investing involves risk, including the
            possible loss of money you invest, and past performance does not
            guarantee future performance. Historical returns, expected returns,
            and probability projections are provided for informational and
            illustrative purposes, and may not reflect actual future
            performance. Please see our Full Disclosure for important details.
